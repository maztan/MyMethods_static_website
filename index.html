            <h3>Carlos Castaneda's "Recapitulation"</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Carlos Castaneda's recapitulation is a technique aimed at reclaiming personal energy by revisiting and releasing past experiences. Here's a more detailed guide to performing this practice:

                Set Up a Dedicated Space: Create a secluded, dark, and quiet environment to minimize distractions. Traditional practitioners often use a "recapitulation box" or tent—a confined space with walls 10-20 inches from the body—to enhance focus. 

                Compile a Comprehensive List: Document all individuals you've interacted with, starting from the most recent and moving backward to your earliest memories. For each person, note significant events, conversations, and emotional exchanges. This exhaustive list serves as the foundation for the recapitulation process. 

                Adopt the Recapitulation Posture: Sit comfortably with your spine straight, either on a chair or the floor. Ensure your breathing is relaxed, and your body is free from tension.

                Perform the Sweeping Breath: This breathing technique is central to recapitulation:

                Inhalation: With your head turned to the right shoulder and lungs emptied, slowly inhale through the nose while moving your head to the left shoulder.
                Exhalation: Reverse the motion by exhaling slowly through the nose as you move your head back to the right shoulder.
                Continue this pattern, synchronizing your breath with the head movements. This "sweeping" action is believed to reclaim energy dispersed during past interactions. 
                
                Vividly Recollect Each Interaction: Focus on one person or event from your list at a time. Recall the setting, dialogue, emotions, and sensory details associated with the interaction. Strive to relive the experience without judgment, observing it as an impartial witness.

                Release and Reintegrate Energy: As you exhale during the sweeping breath, visualize releasing any residual emotions or attachments linked to the memory. With each inhalation, imagine drawing back the energy you invested in that experience, reintegrating it into your being.

                Proceed Methodically Through Your List: Systematically work through each entry on your list, dedicating ample time to fully process and reclaim energy from every interaction.

                Maintain Consistent Practice: Recapitulation is an ongoing discipline that may span months or even years. Regular sessions deepen the cleansing process, leading to increased personal freedom and energy.

            <h3>Klawitherapy.</h3>
            <p>
                This method is a life saver for me (well most of them are). It releases pain and tension.
                The book was available to be bought online, now you probably need to contact them directly <a href="https://www.instytutklawiterapii.com/" target="_blank">Klawitherapy</a>.

            <h3>Falun Dafa</h3>
            <p>
                This is a "stronger" version of Tai-Chi (how I see it).
                The videos showing how to do the exercises are on the official website <a href="https://falundafa.org/en/exercises.html" target="_blank">Falun Dafa exercises</a>.

            <h3>Yoga - P90x Yoga X</h3>
            <p>
                It is important that it is P90x yoga not P90x2 or P90x3 yoga.
                This "version" of yoga is magical. You feel great after you do it.
                Do your best and forget the rest.
                The video with instructions is available on the internet in many places and also can be bought on DVD (not sure about streaming).
